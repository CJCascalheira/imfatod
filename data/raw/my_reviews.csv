M.",Normative substance use antecedents among sexual minorities: A scoping review and synthesis,Psychology of Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity,,,10.1037/sgd0000373,,"Although sexual minority stress remains the dominant perspective for understanding disproportionate substance use among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) populations, social norms are among the most predictive and commonly targeted substance use antecedents in other high-risk groups. This scoping review seeks to bring clarity to the body of norms-focused alcohol, tobacco, and other drug (ATOD) research conducted with LGBs over the past 20 years, identify intervention implications, and present priority directions for future research. Fifty-two peer-reviewed studies published between June 1999 and June 2019 were identified from searches of PubMed, PsycINFO, and Medline databases using combinations of terms related to: social norms; sexual orientation or sexual minority status; and, the use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. A far greater number of studies focused on actual ATOD norms than perceived ATOD norms or discrepancies between actual or perceived norms, illuminating the need for additional research focused on these levels of analysis. Taken together, this literature suggests that: (a) perceived ATOD norms are reliable predictors of LGBs’ ATOD use; (b) actual ATOD use norms are low among LGBs participating in representative, population-based survey studies; and (c) LGBs overestimate the ATOD use of peers. Thus, intervention strategies including personalized normative feedback, psychoeducation, and social branding may hold promise in reducing LGBs substance use. However, additional research is needed to increase our understanding of injunctive ATOD norms, identify meaningful LGB reference groups, elucidate environmental influences on ATOD norms, and examine relationships between stigma experiences, perceived norms, and ATOD use.

M.; Wilson, K.",HIV risk behaviours among immigrant and ethnic minority gay and bisexual men in North America and Europe: A systematic review,Social Science & Medicine,,,10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.02.033,,"HIV surveillance systems show that gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) bear a disproportionate burden of HIV in North American and European countries. Within the MSM category, HIV prevalence is often elevated among ethnic minority (i.e., Latino, Asian, and Black) MSM, many of whom are also foreign-born immigrants. Little research has focused specifically on foreign-born populations, though studies that provide data on the nativity of their samples offer an opportunity to investigate the potential role of transnational migration in informing HIV risk among ethnic minority MSM. This systematic review of ethnic minority MSM studies where the nativity of the sample is known provides a robust alternative to single studies measuring individual-level predictors of HIV risk behaviour. In this review, HIV prevalence, unprotected sex, drug use, and HIV testing are analysed in relation to the ethnicity, nativity, and location of the samples included. The results, which include high rates of HIV, unprotected sex, and stimulant use in foreign-born Latino samples and high rates of alcohol and club drug use in majority foreign-born Asian Pacific Islander (API) samples, provide baseline evidence for the theory of migration and HIV risk as syndemics within ethnic minority populations in North American and European countries. The findings also suggest that further research on the contextual factors influencing HIV risk among ethnic minority MSM groups and especially immigrants within these groups is needed. These factors include ethnic networks, individual post-migration transitions, and the gay communities and substance use cultures in specific destination cities. Further comparative work may also reveal how risk pathways differ across ethnic groups.",2017,01-02-21 12:36,01-02-21 12:40,115-128,,179

We conducted a systematic review of 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of behavioral interventions for reducing condomless anal intercourse (CAI) in SUMSM. Three RCTs observed that cognitive behavioral or motivational interviewing interventions achieved a 24% to 40% decrease in CAI. Interventions also tended to demonstrate greater efficacy for reducing CAI and substance use among those who had lower severity of substance use disorder symptoms. Although behavioral interventions for SUMSM are one potentially important component of biobehavioral HIV/AIDS prevention, further research is needed to examine whether integrative approaches that cultivate resilience and target co-occurring syndemic conditions demonstrate greater efficacy. Multilevel intervention approaches are also needed to optimize the effectiveness of pre-exposure prophylaxis and HIV treatment as prevention with SUMSM.",2016,01-02-21 12:44,01-02-21 12:45,299-306,3,73

It has been also suggested that bisexual individuals (both men and women) have higher rates of depression and anxiety compared with homosexual and heterosexual groups. Aim The aim of the present article was to determine whether or not an association between bisexuality and suicidal behavior exists and to analyze risk factors for suicidal behavior in bisexual individuals. Main Outcome Measures The combined search strategies yielded a total of 339 records screened from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge. Duplicate articles, articles that were not in English, and those that did not analyze bisexuality separately from homosexuality were excluded. A quality assessment was performed for each study included. Methods A careful systematic review of the literature was conducted investigating the potential bisexuality‐suicidal behavior link. A total of 77 articles from peer‐reviewed journals were considered, and the most relevant (N = 19) were selected for this review. Results Individuals reporting a bisexual orientation had an increased risk of suicide attempts and ideation compared with their homosexual and heterosexual peers. Risk factors included related victimization, peer judgments, and family rejection. Bisexual individuals also reported higher rates of mental illness and substance abuse. Conclusions Bisexual individuals may experience more psychological distress and mental health problems than individuals who identify with a homosexual or heterosexual orientation. Clinicians should consider the potential for suicidal behaviors in bisexual individuals and be alert for increased mental health problems and poor social integration.

We conducted a systematic review to identify, synthesize, meta-analyze, and critique the current state of relevant literature. Systematic review methodology was utilized to identify 12 studies that compared MSM with a history of CSA to MSM without a history of CSA on HIV risk indicators including HIV serostatus, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), sexual behaviors, and illicit drug use. Overall, 27.3% (n = 4,263) of the MSM in all included studies (n = 15,622) reported a CSA history. Across the studies that used probabilistic sampling (n = 8,240), the estimated prevalence of CSA was 21.8% (n = 1,800). Meta-analysis indicated that MSM with CSA history were more likely to be HIV positive [odds ratio (OR) = 1.54; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.22?1.95)] and to engage in recent unprotected anal intercourse (OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.36?2.51). Studies also indicated that MSM with a history of CSA were more likely to report frequent casual male partners, substance use, and sex while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. Trends across studies indicated a need for interventions to assess CSA history and address effects of CSA on sexual risk behavior of MSM.

This systematic review provides an update by including numerous recent studies, and explores whether SM individuals are at increased risk across selected mental health problems as per dimensions of sexual orientation (SO), genders, life-stages, geographic regions, and in higher quality studies. A systematic search in PubMed produced 199 studies appropriate for review. A clear majority of studies reported elevated risks for depression, anxiety, suicide attempts or suicides, and substance-related problems for SM men and women, as adolescents or adults from many geographic regions, and with varied SO dimensions (behaviour, attraction, identity), especially in more recent and higher quality studies. One notable exception is alcohol-related problems, where many studies reported zero or reversed effects, especially for SM men. All SM subgroups were at increased risk, but bisexual individuals were at highest risk in the majority of studies. Other subgroup and gender differences are more complex and are discussed.

One of the contributing factors to HIV spread among this group is the use of crystal methamphetamine (?meth?). The objective was to review the behavioral impact of crystal meth use in HIV-infected MSM and potential treatment options. A systematic review of MEDLINE identified studies that evaluated the clinical effects of crystal meth on the HIV-infected MSM population. Search terms included HIV, methamphetamine, MSM, antiretroviral therapy, adherence, resistance, and treatment. U.S. citations in the English language in peer-reviewed journals until December 2010 were included. The primary author reviewed eligible articles, and relevant data including study design, sample, and outcomes were entered into an electronic data table. The 61 included studies highlight that HIV-infected MSM who use crystal meth are more likely to report high-risk sexual behaviors, incident sexually transmitted infections, and serodiscordant unprotected anal intercourse, compared to HIV-infected MSM who do not use crystal meth. Medication adherence in this population is notably low, which may contribute to transmission of resistant virus. No medications have proven effective in the treatment of crystal meth addiction, and the role of behavioral therapies, such as contingency management are still in question. HIV-infected MSM who abuse crystal meth have worse HIV-related health outcomes. Behavioral interventions have shown variable results in treating crystal meth addiction, and more investigation into rehabilitation options are needed. The results presented support efforts to develop and implement novel interventions to reduce crystal meth use in HIV-infected MSM.",2011,01-02-21 13:52,01-02-21 13:54,36-52,1,26

No systematic review has yet identified the predictors and consequences in this vulnerable population of childhood abuse, exposure to sibling abuse and domestic violence, and sibling aggression. This systematic review aims to (a) describe differences in these family victimization rates by sexual orientation, gender, and race/ethnicity; (b) identify potential sexual minority and non-sexual minority-specific risk factors; and (c) identify physical, mental, and behavioral health and extrafamilial victimization correlates. The systematic review, which followed PRISMA guidelines, yielded 32 articles that met study inclusion criteria. Rates of childhood physical, sexual, and emotional abuse were consistently higher for sexual minority youth than for their heterosexual peers. Bisexual youth appear to be at greater risk for physical abuse than their gay and lesbian peers. Younger age at sexual minority milestones (first awareness, disclosure, and same-sex sexual contact) and higher levels of sexual minority-specific (sexuality disclosure, gender non-conformity) and non-sexual minority-specific (delinquent behaviors, parental drinking) risk factors were associated with higher rates of family victimization. Sexual minorities who experienced some form of childhood abuse reported more frequent physical (higher rates of HIV, higher BMIs, lower levels of perceived health), mental (higher rates of depression, PTSD symptoms, experiential avoidance, internalized homophobia), and behavioral (higher rates of suicidality, substance misuse, earlier sexual debut, unprotected anal sex) health problems relative to heterosexual or non-abused sexual minority peers. Sexual minority females who experienced childhood physical or sexual abuse were at greater risk than abused sexual minority males for sexual assault later in life. We conclude this systematic review with recommendations for future research, including the necessity for longitudinal research that utilizes a poly-victimization conceptual framework to identify the developmental pathways connecting risk factors, different types of family victimization, and health and extrafamilial victimization consequences.",2018,02-02-21 12:08,02-02-21 12:09,491-528,5,39

A narrative and quantitative literature review was conducted of 60 papers covering 22 samples from five Western countries. Individual, mean, and median effect sizes (Cohen ds) were calculated whenever possible. Mostly heterosexuals reported higher levels of risk in most reviewed outcomes compared to heterosexuals (unweighted mean effect sizes ranged from 0.20 to 0.50) but typically somewhat lower than bisexuals (unweighted mean effect sizes ranged from ?0.10 to ?0.30). Various risk factors frequently reduced, but rarely eliminated, health disparities between mostly heterosexuals and heterosexuals. Findings are discussed through the lens of three potential explanations of elevated health risks among nonheterosexuals: minority stress, nonheterosexual lifestyles, and common causes.

This theory has widespread adherents in the field, but the extent to which there is empirical support for the concept of disease interaction remains unclear. In January 2015 we systematically searched 7 bibliographic databases and tracked citations to highly cited publications associated with the theory of syndemics. Of the 783 records, we ultimately included 34 published journal articles, 5 dissertations, and 1 conference abstract. Most studies were based on a cross-sectional design (32 [80%]), were conducted in the U.S. (32 [80%]), and focused on men who have sex with men (21 [53%]). The most frequently studied psychosocial problems were related to mental health (33 [83%]), substance abuse (36 [90%]), and violence (27 [68%]); while the most frequently studied outcome variables were HIV transmission risk behaviors (29 [73%]) or HIV infection (9 [23%]). To test the disease interaction concept, 11 (28%) studies used some variation of a product term, with less than half of these (5/11 [45%]) providing sufficient information to interpret interaction both on an additive and on a multiplicative scale. The most frequently used specification (31 [78%]) to test the disease interaction concept was the sum score corresponding to the total count of psychosocial problems. Although the count variable approach does not test hypotheses about interactions between psychosocial problems, these studies were much more likely than others (14/31 [45%] vs. 0/9 [0%]; χ2 = 6.25, P = 0.01) to incorporate language about “synergy” or “interaction” that was inconsistent with the statistical models used.

To develop new theoretical constructs linking social venues and substance use in MSM, we systematically reviewed relevant qualitative studies and re-analysed them using a dimensional analysis method of grounded theory. Our analysis yielded an organising dimension of ‘littoral spaces’ in order to understand the meaning of MSM’s substance use in relation to the social venue. This space is characterised as different from everyday life, through the altering of social boundaries; defined by its illegal qualities; and described as ‘tribal’ and ‘ritual’. Substance use behaviours are embedded as performative regimes within these littoral spaces.

We included any existing studies investigating RDU in MSM and at least one of the following: high-risk sexual practices, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or barriers to accessing specialist support.Results:In total, 112 studies were included. Of them, 38 studies specifically reported the prevalence of chemsex-related drug use. Links with sexualised drug taking and high-risk sexual practices including condomless sex and group sex were reported by several studies.

Searching six online data bases, we identified 938 non-duplicative titles published between 1980 and 2015, of which 97 met all inclusion criteria for our review and reported quantitative tests of associations between discrimination and alcohol use. We extracted key study characteristics and assessed quality based on reported methodological details. Papers generally supported a positive association; however, the quantity and quality of evidence varied considerably. The largest number of studies was of racial/ethnic discrimination among African Americans in the United States, followed by sexual orientation and gender discrimination. Studies of racial/ethnic discrimination were notable for their frequent use of complex modeling (i.e., mediation, moderation) but focused nearly exclusively on interpersonal discrimination. In contrast, studies of sexual orientation discrimination (i.e., heterosexism, homophobia) examined both internalized and interpersonal aspects; however, the literature largely relied on global tests of association using cross-sectional data. Some populations (e.g., Native Americans, Asian and Pacific Islanders) and types of discrimination (e.g., systemic/structural racism; ageism) received scant attention. This review extends our knowledge of a key social determinant of health through alcohol use.

According to minority stress and identity development theories, these experiences can contribute to difficulties with self-acceptance of sexuality. Lower self-acceptance is considered a risk factor for adverse mental health outcomes. The current review aims to investigate whether self-acceptance of sexuality is associated with minority stressors or difficulties with mental health in LGBQ+ individuals, as well as whether there are differences in self-acceptance between different sexual orientations. Five bibliographic databases were searched. Thirteen studies were identified which used quantitative methodology to investigate associations between self-acceptance, minority stressors, and/or mental health within LGBQ+ samples, or differences in self-acceptance between different sexual orientations. The results from these cross-sectional studies suggested that lower self-acceptance of sexuality was associated with higher levels of self-reported minority stressors, including a lack of acceptance from friends and family, a lack of disclosure to others, and internalized heterosexism. Lower self-acceptance of sexuality was associated with poorer mental health outcomes, including greater global distress, depression symptoms, and lower psychological well-being. There was no significant relationship with suicidality. Studies also found that LGBQ+ individuals had lower general self-acceptance compared to heterosexual participants, bisexual individuals had lower sexuality self-acceptance compared to lesbian/gay individuals, and lesbian women had lower sexuality self-acceptance compared to gay men. Given the potential importance of self-acceptance for LGBQ+ populations, further research is required with more robust methodology. Self-acceptance could be a potential target in clinical interventions for LGBQ+ individuals.",2020,10-02-21 14:05,10-02-21 14:06,2353-2373,7,49

However, health disparate groups often face more detrimental consequences of substance abuse including behavioral, social, and medical/mental health (e.g., injury, HIV/AIDS, incarceration, educational attainment, and comorbidity). Failing to characterize risk factors for and consequences of PDM in racial/ethnic minorities may mask the disproportionate negative impact of this epidemic. This systematic review of three research indexes revealed 28 peer-reviewed studies published on PDM in racial/ethnic minority adults. Results indicated a high prevalence of PDM among veterans, bisexual and gay young adults, and substance abusers compared to the general population. Demographic correlates of PDM included younger age, male gender, less educated, unmarried, and those with health/emotional issues.

To address this gap, the current analysis systematically reviewed the masculinity and HIV literature for MSM. The findings of 31 sources were included. Seven themes were identified: (1) number of partners, (2) attitudes toward condoms, (3) drug use, (4) sexual positioning, (5) condom decision-making, (6) attitudes toward testing, and (7) treatment compliance. These factors, representing the enactment of masculine norms, potentiate the spread of HIV. The current article aligns these factors into a masculinity model of community HIV transmission. Opportunities for counseling interventions include identifying how masculinity informs a client’s cognitions, emotions, and behaviors as well as adapting gender-transformative interventions to help create new conceptualizations of masculinity for MSM clients.

We aimed to summarize the association between ATS use and HIV infection among MSM. Methods We conducted a systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, GLOBAL HEALTH and PsycINFO for relevant English, peer-reviewed articles of quantitative studies published between 1980 and 25 April 2013. Pooled estimates of the association ? prevalence rate ratios (PRR, cross-sectional studies), odds ratio (OR, case-control studies) and hazard ratio (HR, longitudinal studies), with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) ? were calculated using random-effects models stratified by study design and ATS group (meth/amphetamines vs. ecstasy). We assessed the existence of publication bias in funnel plots and checked for sources of heterogeneity using meta-regression and subgroup analysis. Results We identified 6710 article titles, screened 1716 abstracts and reviewed 267 full text articles. A total of 35 publications were eligible for data abstraction and meta-analysis, resulting in 56 records of ATS use. Most studies (31/35) were conducted in high-income countries. Published studies used different research designs, samples and measures of ATS use. The pooled association between meth/amphetamine use and HIV infection was statistically significant in all three designs (PRR=1.86; 95% CI: 1.57?2.17; OR=2.73; 95% CI: 2.16?3.46 and HR=3.43; 95% CI: 2.98?3.95, respectively, for cross-sectional, case-control and longitudinal studies). Ecstasy use was not associated with HIV infection in cross-sectional studies (PRR=1.15; 95% CI: 0.88?1.49; OR=3.04; 95% CI: 1.29?7.18 and HR=2.48; 95% CI: 1.42?4.35, respectively, for cross-sectional, case-control and longitudinal studies). Results in cross-sectional studies were highly heterogeneous due to issues with ATS measurement and different sampling frames. Conclusions While meth/amphetamine use was significantly associated with HIV infection among MSM in high-income countries in all study designs, evidence of the role of ecstasy in HIV infection was lacking in cross-sectional studies. Cross-sectional study design, measurement approaches and source populations may also be important modifiers of the strength and the direction of associations. Event-specific measure of individual drug is required to establish temporal relationship between ATS use and HIV infection.

In this study, a systematic review and meta-analysis examining global hepatitis C virus antibody prevalence and estimating active hepatitis C virus prevalence among HIV?+?MSM were conducted; 42 reports provided anti-hepatitis C virus prevalence data among HIV?+?MSM. Pooled prevalence produced an overall anti-hepatitis C virus prevalence among HIV?+?MSM of 8.1%; active HCV prevalence estimate was 5.3%?7.3%. Anti-hepatitis C virus prevalence among injection drug use and non-injection drug use HIV?+?MSM was 40.0% and 6.7%, respectively.

Methods: Seven databases were searched for peer-reviewed research (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Library via Wiley InterScience, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), Health Source: Nursing/Academic, Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science, PsycINFO via EBSCO Host and PubMed). No language restrictions were used. Abstracts were identified in the literature search (n = 734) and were independently read and coded for inclusion or exclusion by two reviewers. When agreement was not reached, a third reviewer acted as arbitrator. Abstracts were included if they presented data collected in the US from 1987 to May 2007 and reported prevalence or correlation of tobacco use with sexual minority status. Studies reporting data from HIV-positive samples were excluded. The identified articles (n = 46) were independently read by two reviewers who recorded key outcome measures, including prevalence and/or odds ratios of tobacco use, sample size and domain of sexuality (identity, behaviour, or desire). Factors relating to study design and methodology were used to assess study quality according to nine criteria. Results: In the 42 included studies, 119 measures of tobacco prevalence or association were reported. The available evidence points to disparities in smoking among sexual minorities that are significantly higher than among the general population. Conclusions: Ongoing, targeted interventions addressing smoking among sexual minorities are warranted in tobacco control programs.",2009,13-03-21 16:28,13-03-21 16:29,275,4,18
